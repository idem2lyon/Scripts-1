scripts
=======
Glorified dumping ground for my personal scripts

authdata.sh - get failed logons from auth.log and find IP geolocation -> output on csv

firewall.sh - the simplest iptables script you can add in your /etc/rc.local

enumerator.sh - scanner + enumerator combo using nmap metasploit and a couple of other tools to enumerate SMTP / SNMP / FTP / Finger / NFS / SMB / TFTP / HTTP and HTTPS
